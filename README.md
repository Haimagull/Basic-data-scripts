Welcome to the "Basic data scripts" repo. Here I will upload all the basic usefull scripts for scientific data analysis (plots, Monte Carlo, etc.). Have fun and don't be shy, ask questions ! If one my scripts is obsolete or not optimized, please tell me (and stay nice). Here you can learn how to :
## Plot
- Plot a mathematical function [https://github.com/Haimagull/Basic-data-scripts/blob/main/plot_ln_2n.py](url)
- Plot multiple functions with one code [https://github.com/Haimagull/Basic-data-scripts/blob/main/2_functions_2_graphs.py](url)
- Plot multiple functions on the same graph [https://github.com/Haimagull/Basic-data-scripts/blob/main/2_functions_samegraph.py](url)
